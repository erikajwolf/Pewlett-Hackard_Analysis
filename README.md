# Pewlett-Hackard_Analysis
## Overview
### Databasing at Pewlett Hackard
After running their employee data via VBA and Excel, PH has asked Bobby to work with SQL to bring databasing to the company. There is a concern wit the impending silver tsunami--the mass retirement of the Baby Boomers. Bobby has been put in charge of discovering which employees will qualify for retirement packages, as well as be prepared to fill all the job vacancies that will be left behind.
